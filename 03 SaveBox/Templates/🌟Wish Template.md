Break this Wish down into **Goals**.

A **Goal** is an action that, once completed, makes it almost impossible for your Wish not to come true.  
It’s the bridge between intention and progress — something fully under your control.

## Step 1 – List Your Goals

Use this structure to write your Goal:  
**Action + measurable outcome + timeframe**

**Examples:**
- Launch 10 products in 4 months  
- Build an email list of 1,000 subscribers in 3 months  

### ✍️ My Goals
*Use links to create each Goal page (prefix: `goal `).*
- [[goal – ]]
-
