  
Now break this Area down into **Wishes** — outcomes you’d love to reach in here.

A **Wish** is something that would make you happy if you reached it, but you don’t fully control the outcome.   Think of it as the _byproduct_ of your Goals.

Use your Wishes as motivation. They remind you why your Goals matter and keep you moving forward.
